# Skin_Cancer_Classification
Classification of skin lesions into 7 different classes, which can be used as a first round of screening by Doctors. This high acurate skin cancer classifier is built using the framework fastai. which is widely used by DL practioners. The dataset and the model details will be discussed as follows. 

Fastai is written on Python and built top of Pytorch, which is one of the flexcible and modern Deep Learning Framework. This is especially built for interdisciplinary people to learn DL in a more easier approach. To know and learn more about Fastai, use the link provided https://course.fast.ai/videos/?lesson=1
